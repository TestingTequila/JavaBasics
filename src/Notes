Encapsulation in Java is a core object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that involves encapsulating variables and the methods that operate on those variables into a single unit, typically a class. It is a mechanism for restricting direct access to some of an object's components, promoting data hiding and protecting the internal state of an object. 


1. Encapsulate variables and methods within a class only
2. Whatever variable you are creating, this should be having access modifier as private
     We have to access those private variable through methods

Mathematics 

Mathematics m1= new Mathematics();
Mathematics m2= new Mathematics();
Mathematics m3= new Mathematics();


Abacus 

Abacus a1= new Abacus();


Car 

Car audi = new Car();
Car merc = new Car();
Car alphaRomeo = new Car();
Car Crysler = new Car();


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Encapsulation: 
1. Variable or method: ensure that we are creating them within the class 
2. Make the variable private and access these private variables using setter and getter methods

Polymorphism:
   -method overloading
       In a class we can have two or more methods with the same, provided that, their signatures are different.
          how can we make the signature different
            i) by making the data type of parameters different
           ii) by changing the order of parameters data type
          iii) by changing the count/number of parameters

OOPs

1. Encapsulation
      -data hiding 

2. Polymorphism [methods with same name]
       -method overloading 
       -method overriding

3. Inheritance 
     -abstraction
     -interface
